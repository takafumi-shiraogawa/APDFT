1) Understand the contraction of the basis set.
2) Understand the integral families
3) Find a way to obtain the integrals for each basis set (use libraries) and extimate the values 
 (compare the results to those obtained by a quantum chemistry program (pyscf-horton)
4) Build a toy model for interpolation of the integrals (may use also PYSCF if faster) 
= overlap
= kinetic
= coulomb attraction
= coulomb bielettronic repulsion

5) Find a problem were customized wave functions are usefull (some solid - vibrational spectra)

6) Grid extimate your integrals 

7) Apply the ml model obtained at 4) to produce excellent results
