Note for implementation of APDFT with molecular geometry changes
From May 24th, 2021.


Flowchart:
1. Calculate and save electronic energy and electron density of
   a reference system
2. Calculate stencil coefficients
3. Calculate one-electron integrals of both terms
4. Update the geometry of the target system
5. Re-calculate integral of the former terms
6. Back to 4


First milestone of the implementation is to calculate the energy
of the charge and geometry changes.
For this purpose, tasks are
1. Make an argument "energies_geometries" for generating input
   files and folders need to be modified.
2. Make directries and inputs of QM calculations for obtaining
   perturbed electron densities with molecular geometry changes.


apdft.commandline.py

change apdft.commandline.build_main_commandline to allow
for 'energies_geometries' for command line arguments

Cost estimation:
   commandline.mode_energies_geometries
   -> derivatives.estimate_cost_and_coverage_general()
   -> physics.estimate_cost_and_coverage_general(self)
   -> physics.enumerate_all_targets_general(self)
   -> apdft.math.IntegerPartitions.partition

Make directories and commands.sh of QM calculations:
   commandline.mode_energies_geometries
   -> derivatives.prepare(conf.debug_validation)
      derivatives.analyse(conf.debug_validation)
   -> physics.apdft.prepare




Note for implementation of higher-order APDFT (higher than APDFT3)
The followings need to be modified:
  For perturbed electron densities
    settings.APDFT.estimate_cost_and_coverage_general
    physics.APDFT.prepare
