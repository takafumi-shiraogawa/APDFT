Note for implementation of APDFT with molecular geometry changes
From May 24th, 2021.


Flowchart:
1. Calculate and save electronic energy and electron density of
   a reference system
2. Calculate stencil coefficients
3. Calculate one-electron integrals of both terms
4. Update the geometry of the target system
5. Re-calculate integral of the former terms
6. Back to 4


First milestone of the implementation is to calculate the energy
of the charge and geometry changes.
For this purpose, tasks are
1. Make arguments for generating input files and folders need
   to be modified.
2.


apdft.commandline.py

change apdft.commandline.build_main_commandline to allow
for 'energies_geometries' for command line arguments
