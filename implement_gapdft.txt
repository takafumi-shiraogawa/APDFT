Note for implementation of APDFT with molecular geometry changes
From May 24th, 2021.


Flowchart:
1. Calculate and save electronic energy and electron density of
   a reference system
2. Calculate stencil coefficients
3. Calculate one-electron integrals of both terms
4. Update the geometry of the target system
5. Re-calculate integral of the former terms
6. Back to 4
